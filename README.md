# WPF Unix Permissions

A small WPF program to help visualise Unix permissions. Also, it uses an MVVM set using Caliburn.Micro.

When I was first starting out building GUIs, I started with PowerShell and WinForm. Whilst I had an absolutely cracking time with that 😭... I decided
to move towards using WPF with C#. After ALOT of learning, testing and failing; I have finally come back to one of my first PowerShell WinFrom
GUIs to update it into WPF and C# code. I even used MVVM by leveraging [Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) 🙌 👨‍💻

You can see my first program from many 'a years ago [here](https://github.com/IT-Delinquent/Unix_Permissions)

### Now onto my new thingy! 🎉

Here is a little Gif of it:

Theres honestly not much to say about this. I had an old thingy and kinda just wanted to show how far I'd come with developing really useless
and almost shit programs 😁 I've put an exe in the repo as well for anyone that wants to use it, may the universe have mercy on you 🥴
